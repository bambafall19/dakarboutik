## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#0EA75A) to align with the existing logo and evoke growth and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F7FA), a desaturated variant of the primary color to give a clean and modern backdrop to showcase products.
- Accent color: A slightly darker shade of green (#0D944F), approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' on the color wheel. This will add contrast and allow particular call to actions stand out from the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look.
- Use simple and professional icons for categories and navigation.
- Maintain a clean, conversion-focused layout with a fixed header, global search bar, and promotional badges.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience.
